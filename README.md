Niji is a port of GeSHi to the Rust programming language.
GeSHi is a generic syntax highlighter, written in PHP. You simply
input the source code you wish to highlight with the language you
wish to use, and the output will be a syntax highlighted version
of that code in one of several available formats.

report at <BenBE@geshi.org>, submit to the [bug tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/GeSHi/niji/issues).
Be aware that minor highlighting errors may well just be incorrect
language files, but if you do find something major please contact me.
